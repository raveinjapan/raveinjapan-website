Rave In Japans Diary

...................................................................................................................................

You dont understand Ive never catched feelings that fast for a girl before I loved you so much
and I wish you loved me the same way I love you, Its like everything reminds me of you even
listening to billie eilish it makes me think of you, your voice is stuck in my head and I cant
get you out I dont understand why we had to end like that you was my world and I honestly loved you
so fucking much If only you could remove that 1 guy I trusted you so much I wanted it work out between
us I really did like you alot, I can just see everything we could of had our first time we met up the first
time our hands collides with eachother I could see it all, all the little dates we would go on, going to concerts
with eachother smiling with one another I wanted you. and only you I really wish you could of got him gone for me 
I really do but maybe just in another life or universe we can come across eachother and truely love eachother and grew
old together.

I just dont understand like I know the actions I have and the way I present myself isnt a good way either but I just want
to make people laugh I want to give people attention I want to be noticed, all of my other exs have cheated on me every
single one of them did it to me I dont know why I dont know what I did wrong I did everything you asked me for I removed
everyone I even went to the point we was spending time 24/7 together talking playing the game laughing now and then and tbh
its not even about the sexual stuff we had I dont care about sexual stuff at all a relationship isnt about sexual shit

All I wanted was normal and simple things.

1. love
2. attention
3. comfort

But theses 3 simple things was just to much, I was never enough for you was I we had such a good day that day i remember saying
"goodnight I love you so much mwa" and while I was sleeping because I wasnt giving you any attention you went out your way and 
started to speak to another guy the thing that just makes me so fucking angry about this all is I told you I legit told you
please dont add any other guys as yes ill admit im insecure and I dont want my woman speaking to other males I dont trust them
from all my past relationships Ive had and Im sorry but that is the way I am and i thought you would accept me for that. It was
suppose to be me and you against the world but I got hurt once again lmao

I actually give up why cant I just be happy every girl I come across is always wanting me for something I fucking hate it so much
there always asking for sexual stuff I dont fuck with that I want love I want it to be the right person.
